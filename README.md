# Movie-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis

Sentiment analysis of a movie review can rate how positive or negative a movie review is and hence the overall rating for a movie. Therefore, the process of understanding if a review is positive or negative can be automated as the machine learns through training and testing the data.

In this project we learned:

   How to load text data and clean it to remove punctuation and other non-words.
   How to develop a vocabulary, tailor it, and save it to file.
   How to prepare movie reviews using cleaning and a predefined vocabulary and save them to new files ready for modeling
